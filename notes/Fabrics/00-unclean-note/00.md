Look at the Image-001, the first one is 

Data Factory : Azure Data Factory 
DE : 
DW : 
Data Science : 
REAL TIME INT:
DB 


We do not need to platform , do not need to switch to the things , do not worry about the integrations , networking . PBI is the part of cloud family . Fabric is also part of azure family. 

What storage 

The image-001 is all about the overview of Fabric.

In the first layer is called Organizational Tenant , to simply say that when we created an Azure account with our Email is consider an organizations , it has everythings , 

in Azure we created resources , in fabric we create similar thing but we add capacity . 

Capacity is bundle of resouces or package of resouces which include ram , storage and so 

 It decide the computation power of that particular resouces . For example we can create multiple capacity for multy perpouse 

for example we have a bussiness which has 3 bracnh in the usa , uk and Germany . 

In the usa branch we have a capacity which has F-32 units , UK for F-16 and Germany for 

workspace : are similar to azure resources group , to simple called folder or container . we can create multiple workspcae in a capacity .

One Lake ( One drive for Data )

![One Lake  One drive for Data](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h6lhfdzfgr0x3ap3vwiv.png)

we can put anything in the one drive right ? like a images , files , videos and so on . 

In the onelake it is also build on ADLS Gen 2  ( Azure Data Lake Gen 2 ) 
.


it can handel sem-structured data 
unstructured data 
structured data 


semi ( CSV ) 
Unstruct ( IMAGE) 

how it store data structured ? 

Structurd - it store all the structured data in the format of DELTA-PERQUET FORMAT automatically 


in azure its called GEN-2 where it is similar in the AWS called S3 , Google Cloud Storge for GCP 


Qestions: As everything handel by  the azure data storage so why do we need the ONELAKE ? 

- 

whenever we create or perform any task in the azure we have to create different different storage accounts . 
For example to store STREM data we can create storage account , to store flat files we create storage , to store different actions we have to create the different types of storage accounts 


when the no of service rise the no of storage accounts increase . Those not only headace to maintain but also create problem to connect with each others 

so maicrosft fabric introduce the ONELAKE where we can done all all the actives whatever we have to need . There is no need to worry about maintain , networking 

that is why it is called the logical data lake.

Every workspace appears as a container within that storage account, and different data items appear as folders within those containers.

One Copy of Data (One lake = Fabric Data lake ) 

it can solve many problems such as 
-
- Data Redundancy (LRS.GRS,GZRS)
- 


Delta Parquet Format 
-------------------------------

we have a file called data1.parquet 
;
; a columner file format , data column by columns
.
. 

Delta Lake is the backbone of the lakehouse 

we know the file format is only called .parquet format , right ? so where the terms comes from the delta ? or what does mean by the 
DELTA-PARQUET ? 

a file is format in parquet , when we add DELTA-LOG ( Transectional log ) with the file format 
it becomes the delta-parquet format . 

the good things is that multiples files does not requires the multiples delta log 

why delta log ? 
it keeps all the transactional procedure 
- ACID properties 
- Data Versions 

so it is not store in .delta or .delta-parquet format , there is no file format like this . It store in the (.parquet format )
